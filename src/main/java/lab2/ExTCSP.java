		In a restaurant, we have both a human barman and a robot
		waiter. Both can prepare coffees, but only the robot waiter can
		deliver items to guests. A guest enters the restaurant and orders a
		coffee at time 3. The human waiter takes between 5 and 7 minutes to
		prepare a coffee, while the robot waiter takes 8 to 10 minutes to
		prepare a coffee. The trip form the counter where the prepared coffee
		is placed when ready to any guest table is either 5 to 10 minutes long
		if the robot navigates through the tables and guests, or 7 minutes
		long if it chooses a fixed predefined path.  The serving coffee task
		is fully accomplished when the robot brings a sugar pot to the guestâ€™s
		table. This action is either takes 4 to 10 minutes taking the first
		pre-defined path or 6 to 8 minutes taking the second path.  In order
		to avoid the coffee getting cold, the sugar pot should be served at
		most 12 minutes after the is coffee prepared. The whole serving time
		(i.e., waiting time for both coffee and sugar) should not exceed 15
		minutes.
